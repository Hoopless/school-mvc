School Assignment build an MVC website.

## Configuration
Rename `config.example.php` to `config.php` and setup the routing as correct. 

If you are using NGINX you can set the URLroot to an empty string as long you use the root of this project as basic configuration.
The try files for nginx are: `$uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string`.

The MSQL file can be found in the core folder, so you can setup the database.
